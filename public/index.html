    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 25px;"><p> -I have created a game with 2 of my Grade 12 Computer Science friends using object-oriented programming.
      Its gameplay is a simple, timed game where a player has around 4 seconds to take out every enemy with projectiles.
      Below is a video I created showcasing the game and its code.

    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 25px;"><p> -I have created multiple Arduino projects, and an example of which is a timer shown on an LCD 
      display. It was created first on a website called "Tinkercad", where I also typed up the code. After that,
       I built it with an Arduino kit of my own, and uploaded the code from the Arduino IDE to my Arduino board. A video of it is shown below.

    <a name="andysFuturePlans"></a>
    <img src="nintendo.png" align=right width="400" height="100" style="margin: 10px;"> 
    <h4 style="margin-left: 25px;"><p> I mentioned before that I have gained an interest in developing video games after playing them all my life. Well, that's exactly
      what I want to do. Create, design, and play video games. Since I really like playing them, I figured I might as well make it a career path for me.
      I understand the general path for such a career probably goes something like go to a post-secondary institution to study more computer science or 
      software engineering, obtain some experience through creating indie games, being a gametester and slowly building a portfolio, and then try to apply to some game company, 
      or start my own. In my case, I am much more interested in working under the game companies whose games I played as a kid, like Nintendo. My favorite game
      is made by Nintendo, "Kirby's Return to Dreamland." That is basically my future plan, as of now.
