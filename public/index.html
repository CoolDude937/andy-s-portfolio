    <h1><center> Welcome to my website. Let me begin by telling you a little about myself.</h1>

    <ul>
      <li><h2> I am a Grade 12 Chinese-Canadian high school student attending schooling at Maxwell Heights Secondary School.</li>
      <li><h2> I was born, raised, and have lived in Oshawa, Ontario for my entire 16 years of life. </li>
      <li><h2> My birthday is December 23rd, right before Christmas, but as a result I am the youngest in my grade. </h2></li>
      <li><h2> I love video games, and I have gained an interest to help develop them as my career path. </li>

    <h1><center> Here's some of the stuff I've done over the years. </h1>
    <h1 style = "text-align: left;"> 1) General Academics</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><p>-Last year in Grade 11, I finished with a 96 grade average, and
      in Grade 12 I am going to try and remain consistent with my grades, and so far I 
      have been able to do so, with my 2 current completed courses averaging at a 98.

    <h1 style="text-align: left;"> 2) Computer Science and Robotics Achievements</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><p> -I have created a game with 2 of my Grade 12 Computer Science friends using object-oriented programming.
      Its gameplay is a simple, timed game where a player has around 4 seconds to take out every enemy with projectiles.
      Below is a video I created showcasing the game and its code.

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;"><p> -I have created multiple Arduino projects, and an example of which is a timer shown on an LCD 
      display. It was created first on a website called "Tinkercad", where I also typed up the code. After that,
       I built it with an Arduino kit of my own, and uploaded the code from the Arduino IDE to my Arduino board. A video of it is shown below.

    <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;"><center>What I want to do in the future</center></h1>
    <img src="nintendo.png" align=right width="400" height="100" style="margin: 10px;"> 
    <h2><p> I mentioned before that I have gained an interest in developing video games after playing them all my life. Well, that's exactly
      what I want to do. Create, design, and play video games. Since I really like playing them, I figured I might as well make it a career path for me.
      I understand the general path for such a career probably goes something like go to a post-secondary institution to study more computer science or 
      software engineering, obtain some experience through creating indie games, being a gametester and slowly building a portfolio, and then try to apply to some game company, 
      or start my own. In my case, I am much more interested in working under the game companies whose games I played as a kid, like Nintendo. My favorite game
      is made by Nintendo, "Kirby's Return to Dreamland." That is basically my future plan, as of now.
