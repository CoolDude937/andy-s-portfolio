    <h2 style = "text-align: left;"> 1) General Academics</h2>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px;"><p>-Last year in Grade 11, I finished with a 96 grade average, and
      in Grade 12 I am going to try and remain consistent with my grades, and so far I 
      have been able to do so, with my 2 current completed courses averaging at a 98.

    <h2 style="text-align: left;"> 2) Computer Science Achievements</h2>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><p> -I've created a game with 2 of my Grade 12 Computer Science friends using object-oriented programming.
      Its gameplay is a simple, timed game where a player has around 4 seconds to take out every enemy with projectiles.
      Below is a video I created showcasing the game and its code.
