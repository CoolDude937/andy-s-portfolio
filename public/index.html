    <h2><p> -I've created a game with 2 of my Grade 12 Computer Science friends using object-oriented programming.
      Its gameplay is a simple, timed game where a player has around 4 seconds to take out every enemy with projectiles.
      To the right is a video I created showcasing the game and its code.
